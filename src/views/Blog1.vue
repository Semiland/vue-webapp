                                <br>
                                <p>The China Innovation and Entrepreneurship Contest, the Small and Medium Enterprises Integration Professional Competition and the 2019 Innovation Songhu Entrepreneurship Competition New Material Industry Competition have been completed since the start of the Oct. 23rd, and finals have been completed. Semiland Co., Ltd won the first place in new material group and first prize of the national finals.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>据赛事组委会介绍，2019年创新松湖创业大赛在中国创新创业大赛组委会的指导下，以聚焦产业、促成落户为主要目标，采用“1＋1＋N”模式，与中国创新创业大赛大中小企业融通专业赛充分结合。</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>According to the event organizing committee, under the guidance of the China Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition Organizing Committee, the 2019 Innovation Songhu Entrepreneurship Competition focuses on industries and promotes settlement as its main goal. It adopts the "1 + 1 + N" model to fully integrate with China's innovation and entrepreneurship competitions.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>大赛融合了华为、百度两个国赛专场，并联合腾讯、万科、生益等龙头企业共同办赛，由龙头企业牵头，松山湖材料实验室、松山湖国际机器人产业基地等大研发机构支撑、再配合孵化器、创投、银行等资源要素，形成政府给引导资金、大企业给资源、孵化器给场地、金融机构给投资的产业闭环生态。</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The competition combines the two national competitions of Huawei and Baidu, and jointly organizes the competition with leading companies such as Tencent, Vanke, and Shengyi. The competition is led by leading companies, supported by large R & D institutions such as Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory and Songshan Lake International Robot Industry Base. Together with the resource elements such as incubators, venture capital, and banks, a closed-loop ecosystem of the industry is provided by the government to guide funds, large enterprises to resources, incubators to sites, and financial institutions to invest.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>同时，本届大赛与松山湖园区创业领军人才政策实现对接，大赛总决赛“以赛代评”，筛选5个特等奖项目，落户并符合条件的，获得领军人才政策资助，最高可获得300万元创业资金。</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>At the same time, this competition is connected with the Songshan Lake Park entrepreneurial leader talent policy. The competition finals will be evaluated “by competition”, and 5 special awards will be selected. Those who settle down and meet the requirements will receive funding from the leader talent policy, up to 3 million Yuan venture capital.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>记者从新材料行业赛组织方了解到，入围复赛的团队均为具备自主知识产权，而且能有效解决当前产业界卡脖子技术的创新团队。相关材料技术与新能源、生物医药、通讯科技、精密制造等领域重叠，充分体现新材料作为工业之王的地位。</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The reporter learned from the organizers of the new materials industry competition that the teams that entered the rematch are independent innovation teams that have independent intellectual property rights and can effectively solve the current industry card neck clamping technology. Related materials technologies overlap with new energy, biomedicine, communication technology, precision manufacturing and other fields, fully reflecting the status of new materials as the king of industry.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>本次创新松湖新材料行业专项赛的独特之处是，有首批广东省级实验室之一的松山湖材料实验室与龙头企业生益科技以及产业孵化器中集智谷三方合作，实现了原始创新机构、孵化平台和产业化路径的有效整合。三方将以本次大赛为载体，联合打造大湾区新材料产业供需对接大会，帮助新材料企业快速落地成长。</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The unique feature of this innovative Songhu New Materials Industry Competition is that the Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, one of the first batch of Guangdong provincial laboratories, cooperated with the leading company Shengyi Technology and the industrial incubator CIMC Wisdom Triangle to achieve the effective integration of original innovation institutions, incubation platforms and industrialization paths. The three parties will use this competition as a carrier to jointly create a supply and demand docking conference for the new materials industry in the Greater Bay Area to help new materials companies grow quickly.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>值得关注的是，松山湖材料实验室经研究决定，将最优厚的入驻条件开放给参赛者，只要符合松山湖材料实验室创新样板工厂“直通车”项目条件，即可跳过项目初筛等阶段，直接进入会议评审阶段。通过评审的项目可入驻松山湖材料实验室，获得最高达2000万元的项目经费资助，以及全方位的技术、产业资源。</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>It is worth noting that the Songshan Lake Material Laboratory has decided to open the optimal entry conditions to the participants after discussion. As long as it meets the conditions of the "through train" project of the Songshan Lake Material Laboratory's innovative model factory, it can skip the preliminary screening of the project Phase, directly into the meeting evaluation phase. Projects that pass the evaluation can enter the Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, get a project budget of up to 20 million yuan, and a full range of technical and industrial resources.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>颁奖典礼后，松山湖新材料创新创业供需见面会顺利举行，共18个项目与21个风头、企业报名参加。</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>After the award ceremony, the Songshan Lake New Materials Innovation and Entrepreneurship Supply and Demand Meeting was successfully held. There are 18 projects and 21 VCs and firms in the industry signed up.</p>
